  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This is a plug-in which can be used to perform jmeter testing on a
  Geomajas server. The plugin consists of:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>a server project that should be added as a jar to the Geomajas
      server web application (or at build time using maven dependency). This
      will install a Spring controller that exposes the command dispatcher
      through the Spring HTTP invoker protocol.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>a client project that (along with some dependencies) should be
      installed in the JMETER_HOME/lib/ext folder. This will create an extra
      java sampler class
      <code>org.geomajas.plugin.jmeter.GeomajasSamplerClient</code> in the
      dropdown list of the Java Request Sampler configuration window. For
      usage of this sampler, see the configuration instructions of this
      plugin.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>The plugin will allow to fetch a number of tiles from one or more
  layers of a Geomajas project. Tiles can be concurrently fetched with
  multiple threads in a thread group. Tiles can be optionally saved for
  verification. Tiles can be fetched using 2 run modes:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>random mode: tiles are taken randomly from all scale levels of all
      allowed layers</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>topdown mode: tiles are taken from the top scale level (lowest
      scale) and going down to the lower levels (higher scales). </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>The top down mode can be used to seed one or more layers on the
  server.</para>
